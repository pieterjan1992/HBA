SESSION 1:

The big bang theory movie notes:
The first clip shows how if you open up things that are connected on the internet people 
could use them. in the clip is it is made to be funny but this could also be used against 
you. This idea would be possible

Scenario:
Lighting, Entertainment, remote access

Technologies : Remote access, RC Cars, webcams, lighting, stereo

Feasable : Yes.

Weirdness: not that weird it is totally doable.

The siemens project video:

Scenario: Knowing which vehicles and persons have entered a building.
Energy management meaning distribution, storage, smart city, personal navigation, 

Technologie:Automatic lighting, automated parking, body scanning, flow detection,
Mobile devices, smart elevators

Feasable:No, too much data flow would make the system hard to implement.
Also very hard to make this secure against hacks.

weirdness: very big scale hard to realize.

PROBLEMS:

problem with import Rpi.GPIO in python script had to apt-get install python-dev
and then install the RPi-GPIO

problem with installing git to install the gpio had to update apt-get

problem with connection the pi to the internet had to change the resolv.conf file. 

installing the imap client gave an error did and upgrade command that seemed to work

Had a problem with turning on the GPIO pins with the command line. Had to set the pin
mode to out before it worked

SESSION 2:

Installed mosquitto to have an mqtt server with the apt-get install mosquitto command.

Installed the python mqtt library with pip install paho-mqtt.

Ran the basic script and modified it to turn on the led on GPIO port 16 with the start
and stop command.

I had a problem getting how i had to do mqtt and turn the led on. Sebastian gave me a
good website where it was all good explained and documented.

https://pypi.python.org/pypi/paho-mqtt/1.1

Also had some problems with python so i had to look up how things worked on stack overflow.

red a tutorial on python that used a raspberry pi

http://blog.bandwidth.com/actually-using-your-raspberry-pi-part-3-teaching-everyone-the-basics-of-python/?utm_medium=social&utm_source=reddit&utm_campaign=dtolb&utm_content=_

Installed an ubuntu virtual machine but haven't configured the serial port yet.

Useful commands/remarks:

install mosquito server apt-get install mosquito -> this was needed to install 
the MQTT server

gpio -g mode 20 out -> for putting a gpio port as output

mosquitto fx has a jar that has a user interface

SESSION 3:

I had problems with my virtual machine and have not configured the serial connection with pio

openhab installed on the raspberry through filezilla in the opt/openhab folder

installed java with apt-get install default-jdk

had problems with the openhab demo because i forgot to put the demo in the right maps

Getting the led to work :

followed the guide on https://mcuoneclipse.com/2015/12/24/blinky-led-with-openhab-on-raspberry-pi/

i have a problem with my leds they turn off automatically because something crashes
i still have to put on the log and see why.(maybe because of the usage of the gpio command)

turning on the led with the button the gpio changes from zero to one when pressed 
but when i try to to change the led to on it doesn’t work with sendUpdate

i had a problem because the led was not turning on i checked the gpio port everything
was set correctly i changed it to another port and it worked. couldn’t replicate the problem

Used the following tutorial to do the GPIO Binding:
https://github.com/openhab/openhab/wiki/GPIO-Binding

I Had a problem with creating a group for the led as i couldn't figure out how it was 
done by the examples i asked sebastian for help and he showed me an easy way.

Explanation of items in openhab:
https://github.com/openhab/openhab/wiki/Explanation-of-items

found a lot of example rules:
https://github.com/openhab/openhab/wiki/Samples-Rules

documentation on rules:
https://github.com/openhab/openhab/wiki/Rules

SESSION 4:

Notes from the other guys on how they did enocean
-connect the connector with the pi
-the router from enocean is connected with the serial pins
-disable the serial tty
-include the enocean binding
-setup in the configuration of openhab so it connects to the right serial
-when you define the switch in the enocean config you have to give in the serial number

site for all information about setting up hue: http://huelights.com/faq.html#faq-1000

https://www.dmlights.com/philips-hue-faq.l#38 (from flo)

There was a problem with lampstealer we could not reset the lamps so we used telnet to reset the lamp connection.

https://github.com/openhab/openhab/wiki/Hue-Binding

we then followed this link : https://github.com/openhab/openhab/wiki/Hue-Binding
to connect the Hue to openhab but it didn't work since philips last month updated their
firmware of the bridges to be more secure. details of the update can be found here:
http://www2.meethue.com/en-us/support/firmware-update/

i looked at the code and it seemed we needed version 1.8.3 before it could work.
we tested it with no results until flo came up with the solution
